# Superstore Dataset

Hi everyone,
I am very excited to share a project that I have completed on Excel. The name of the project is " Sales Dashboard". The main objective of the project is to create a sales dashboard using Excel to analyze factors affecting the sales and profit,correlation between discount and profit and top customers who are making profit.

# Dataset

- The Dataset is : [SuperStore-DataSet](https://github.com/Raj4478/Data-Analysis-Project/files/12224915/_198060205f23f90d686a40d6a99a8fc7_Full-Sales-Superstore-Dataset.xlsx)

# Project Steps overview

- Understanding the dataset.

- Check and remove all the null and duplicate values in the dataset.

- Add two more columns in the dataset i.e year and month from the order date column with the help of year and month formula in Excel.

- Created Pivot tables, Chart, and Graphs to summarise the data and visually get quick information.

- Finally, I built a dashboard in tableau using the above dataset.


# Key insights :  

- Profit has an inverse relation with Discount.As Discount increases profit decreases.

- Tamara chand is the customer who makes the highest profit.

- The states which have maximum number  of sales in California.

- Yearly profits are gained in the technology and office category in Data-Analysis-Project
